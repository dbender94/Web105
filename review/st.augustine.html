 <h2>The City Apart From Others!</h2>
 <img src="staugustine.jpg" alt="" style="width: 310px;" height="110px">
 <p>Its unique scenery and history set this city apart from any other in the country. This old city has a quaint feel but
      boasts a big appeal. Visitors can see why when they stroll along the brick-lined streets and delight in the city's 
      European flavor, with centuries-old buildings, horse-drawn carriages, hidden courtyards, and so much more. Saint
       Augustine has plenty of history to explore -- more than 450 years of it! In addition to its impressive roster of 
       top-rated hotels, resorts and bed and breakfasts, St. Augustine is known for its excellent restaurants serving a 
       variety of dishes reflecting the town's multicultural heritage. Add to that the city's world-class art galleries, 
       boutiques and outlet shopping, theater and live music, and 42 miles of gorgeous beaches, and it's easy to see why 
       more than 6 million visitors come here each year. We have put together a comprehensive guide to everything it has
        to offer -- from fun and free local events to tour services, parks and attractions. Our information is current and
         accurate, providing a clear description and address for every hotel, attraction, shop, restaurant and more</p>

        <h2>THE FORT</h2>
        <p>The oldest masonry fort in the continental United States, the Castillo de San Marcos is a large Spanish stone
             fortress built to protect and defend Spain's claims in the New World. It's a National Monument and, at over 
             315 years old, it's the oldest structure in St. Augustine. It's also one of the main attractions visitors to
              St. Augustine come to see. There's plenty of things to do at the Castillo, from the numerous rooms that once
               housed soldiers and prisoners, to the large interior courtyard and gun deck which offers a great view of the
                city.</p>

        <h2>ST AUGUSTINE GHOST TOUR</h2>
        <p>Listed on the Florida and National Register of Haunted Places, there’s plenty of hair-raising to be had in the
            nation’s oldest city. Walk through the Old Jail where dank odors, cold spots and clamorous noises haunt the 
            cells. Potter’s Wax Museum’s Chamber of Horrors will put more tingle in your spine with the tale of pirate 
            Andrew Ranson’s gruesome execution and you won’t find a remedy for fear at the Old Drug Store where the 
            prescription is always a healthy dose of the jitters.</p>
