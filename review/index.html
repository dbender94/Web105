       <h2>THIS IS WHY EVERYONE SHOULD VISIT FLORIDA AT LEAST ONCE!</h2>
       <P>The Sunshine State offers incredible weather year-round. With blue skies, beautiful beaches, delicious 
           seafood and plenty of day trip adventures, Florida is a perpetual vacation. Here are a few reasons to visit the
            sunny state now (or anytime really).</P>


            <h2>BEACHES, BEACHES AND MORE BEACHES</h2>
            <img src="beaches.jpg" alt="beach of florida">
            <p>With FL having so many beaches, you are bound to lay back, throw on your shades and soak in the sun and just 
                let all your worries, fears, stresses go. while visiting florida you will never be far from any beach really 
                and listening to the waves is bound to leave you feeling refreshed and ready to go on to the next adventure! </p>

        <h2>Florida</h2>
        <img src="florida.jpg" alt="florida" style="width: 290px;height: 290px;">
        <p>Florida was made a state in 1845. Over the years Florida has become one of the top states visited by people all
            over the world. Everyone should visit florida at least once in their life! Florida is known as the "sunshine state"
            and many people think that florida is always hot year round. It really isnt the heat though that makes people complain
            it is actually the humidty! Florida has the most golf courses over any other state. It also is one of the only states that
            almost every part has a border to the ocean! Florida is a state you can visit anytime of the year! I would defintly 
            recommened visiting in the beginning of December because the tempeture is just right and it the time when people least visit.

    <h2>WILDLIFE</h2>
    <img src="alligator.jpg" alt="wildlife" style="float:left;width:300px;height:220px">
    <p>The Florida peninsula is rich with wildlife. The sawgrass marshes and mangrove forests of the Everglades National 
        Park are home to 350 bird species, 27 different kinds of snakes, fresh and saltwater fish, the bottlenose dolphin, 
        alligators, crocodiles and the Florida panther. Bird-watching is possible in over 500 locations all over the state, 
        and tens of millions of monarch butterflies fill the Florida sky all along their migration route from Canada to 
        Mexico. Visitors can easily spot manatees, the gentle sea cows native to Florida, in shallow slow-moving waters 
        (such as your neighborhood canal); they migrate each winter in large numbers where they join at the Crystal River 
        National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
