   <h2>Criminal Justice</h2>

<p>I have attached a picture of a crime scene since I am going into the criminal Justice field. Crime scenes are at every site that there is a homicide, robbery, or any type of 
    criminal activity  
    People are often scared of crime scenes but I find them very intersting. Pretty much every police department uses crime scenes everyday to gather evidence. 
<h2>Race Horse</h2>

<p>Growing up I owned a horse, her name was El Veda. She stood 17.3 hands tall and I had to use a later to get on 
    her back. She raced at Arlington Park Race track until she was 7 years old. She had shattered her front knee and had 
    to be retired. Elli use to shake her head yes when she wanted apple treats and her head no when she didnt want a bath.

<H2>Cat in a tree</H2>
<img src="Cat in a tree.jpg" alt="little kitten in tree">
<p>My whole life I was in awe of kittens. My mom hated cats and always told me no to getting one. My dad on the other <hand class="">
    bought me my first kitten after my mom had repeatedly said nope. Me and my dad shared a special bond with our love for cats.
    He didnt just stop at getting me 1..nope he allowed me to keep another one kinda like the one in the pic after I resuced
    him from outside. My mom was not happy at all. But my dad made me the happiest girl in the world!!
